To overcome this problem, Smith et al.(2006) demonstrated that using ensembles of separately trained models and combining them in a logarithmic opinion pool (LOP) leads to better parameter values.

Raw parallel data need to be preprocessed in the modern phrase-based SMT before they are aligned by alignment algorithms, one of which is the wellknown tool, GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), for training IBM models (1-4).
P03-1021
In the original work (Brown et al., 1993) the posterior probability p(eI1|fJ1 ) is decomposed following a noisy-channel approach, but current stateof-the-art systems model the translation probability directly using a log-linear model(Och and Ney, 2002): p(eI1|fJ1 ) = exp parenleftBigsummationtextM m=1 mhm(e I1,fJ1 ) parenrightBig summationdisplay ?eI1 exp parenleftBigsummationtextM m=1 mhm(?eI1,fJ1 ) parenrightBig, (2) with hm different models, m scaling factors and the denominator a normalization factor that can be ignored in the maximization process.

The most important distinction between the treelet in (Quirk et al., 2005) and ours is that we allow variables at positions of subnodes.

treelet translation We previously described (Quirk et al, 2005) a linguistically syntax-based system that parses the source language, uses word-based alignments to project a target dependency tree, and extracts paired dependency tree fragments (treelets) instead of surface phrases.

This parsing approach is very similar to the one used successfully by Nivre et al.(2006), but we use a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996) to determine parser actions, which makes parsing extremely fast.

With these considerations in mind, feature engineering is an active area of research (Och et al., 2004).

The alignment template approach (Och & Ney, 2004) uses word classes rather than lexical items to model phrase translation.

We employ the phrase-based SMT framework (Koehn et al., 2003), and use the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007), and the SRILM language modelling toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), and evaluate our decoded translations using the BLEU measure (Papineni et al., 2002), using a single reference translation.

In contrast to the work by Lin (2004) and by Quirk et al.(2005), the DTSC model does not need to generate target language dependency structures using source structures and word alignments.
P05-1034
To evaluate the result of the translation, the BLEU metric (Papineni et al.2002) was used.

The conditional log-linear feature combination framework (Berger, Della Pietra and Della Pietra, 1996) is remarkably simple and effective in practice.

It also contains tools for tuning these models using minimum error rate training (Och 2003) and evaluating the resulting translations using the BLEU score (Papineni et al.2002). Moses uses standard external tools for some of the tasks to avoid duplication, such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney 2003) for word alignments and SRILM for language modeling.

The comparison phrasal system was constructed using the same GIZA++ alignments and the heuristic combination described in (Och & Ney, 2003).

An early attempt at greater generality in a purely phrasal setting was the alignment template approach (Och & Ney 2004); newer approaches include formally syntactic (Chiang 2005), and linguistically syntactic approaches (Quirk et al.2005), (Huang et al.2006). In the next section, we examine these representative approaches to the reordering problem.

order templates For each pair of parallel training sentences, we parse the source sentence, obtain a source dependency tree, and use GIZA++ word alignments to project a target dependency tree as described in Quirk et al.(2005).

If the upper bound is close to state-of-the-art systems performance then we need to look for other summarizationmethodstoimproveperformance.Ifthe upper bound is much higher than any current systems canachieve,thenitisreasonabletoinvestmoreeffortin sentence extraction methods. The question is how to estimatetheperformanceupperbound.Oursolutionis tocastthisestimationproblemasanoptimizationproblem. We exhaustively generate all possible sentence combinationsthatsatisfygivenlengthconstraintsfora summary, for example, all the sentence combinations totaling 1005 words. We then compute the unigram co-occurrence score for each sentence combination, against the ideal. The best combinations are the ones withthehighestunigramco-occurrencescore.Wecall this sentence combination the oracle extract. Figure 1 showsanoracleextractfordocumentAP900424-0035.
